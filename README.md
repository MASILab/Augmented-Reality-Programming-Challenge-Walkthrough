# Maker Challenge: Augmented Reality Programming Challenge
<p>In this maker challenge, students will explore augmented reality (AR) physiology programs, including muscle and bone overlays and a body tracking recording program, using Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio. Using the engineering design process, students will modify, enhance, and redesign the program to meet a real-world need.</p>

<h2>What is the Engineering Design Process?</h2>
<p>The engineering design process is a process engineering teams use to solve problems. There are several steps involved, and the steps are <b>iterative</b>, meaning that steps are repated as many times as needed. The steps of the engineering design process are: ask, research, imagine, plan, create, test, and improve. You can learn more about the engineering design process <a href="https://www.teachengineering.org/design/designprocess">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Materials, Download & Installation</h2>
<p>To begin working on this project, you will need a computer to access certain software. You will also need an <a href="http://shop.orbbec3d.com/Astra-Pro_p_35.html">Orbbec Astra Pro Camera</a>. The following intructions provide a step by step walkthrough on the download/installation process for the software you'll be using.</p>

<h3>Microsoft Visual Studio 2017(or later)</h3>
<p>This is where you will build your code. Micrsoft Visual Studio 2017(or later) is available <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/">here</a>. Once there, click the relevant download according to your operating system. For example, if you have a Windows computer, download Visual Studio Community for windows. You can access more detailed download instructions for each operating system below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019">Windows</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/installation?view=vsmac-2019"<li>macOS</li></a>
</ul>

<h3>Download Unity v. 2018.2.9(or later)</h3>
<p>Unity is where we will build our demos. It has the ability to create screens and a variety of other useful features. You can download Unity <a href="https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual">here</a>. On the 'Individual' tab, you can select the student or personal plan. For the purposes of this walkthrough, we'll select the 'Personal' plan.</p>

<h3>AR Physiology Demo Downloads</h3>
<p>Now it's time to choose the demo you would like to work on. There are three main AR Physiology demos to choose from. The <a href="https://github.com/MASILab/AR_Mirror_Muscle_Demo_Clean">Muscle Demo</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/MASILab/AR_Mirror_Bone_Demo_Clean">Bone Demo</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/MASILab/AR_Mirror_Replay_Demo_Clean">Replay Demo</a>. The muscle demo will allow you to view different muscles within the body, the bone demo will allow you to view different bones within the body, and the replay demo allows you to automatically record and replay your renders. You can explore each demo and begin thinking about what demo you'd like to work on. For example, here's a preview of what the bone demo looks like:</p>
