# Maker Challenge: Augmented Reality Programming Challenge
<p>In this maker challenge, students will explore augmented reality (AR) physiology programs, including muscle and bone overlays and a body tracking recording program, using Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio. Using the engineering design process, students will modify, enhance, and redesign the program to meet a real-world need.</p>

<h2>What is the Engineering Design Process?</h2>
<p>The engineering design process is a process engineering teams use to solve problems. There are several steps involved, and the steps are <b>iterative</b>, meaning that steps are repated as many times as needed. The steps of the engineering design process are: ask, research, imagine, plan, create, test, and improve. You can learn more about the engineering design process <a href="https://www.teachengineering.org/design/designprocess">here</a>.</p>
