# Maker Challenge: Augmented Reality Programming Challenge
<p>In this maker challenge, students will explore augmented reality (AR) physiology programs, including muscle and bone overlays and body tracking recording program, using Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio. Using the engineering design process, students will modify, enhance, and redesign the program to meet a real-world need.</p>

<h2>What is the Engineering Design Process?</h2>
<p>The engineering design process is a process engineering teams use to solve problems. There are several steps involved, and the steps are <b>iterative</b>, meaning that steps are repated as many times as needed. The steps of the engineering design process are: ask, research, imagine, plan, create, test, and improve. You can learn more about the engineering design process <a href="https://www.teachengineering.org/design/designprocess">here</a>.</p>
